//! A crate to list WiFi hotspots in your area.
//!
//! As of v0.5.x now supports macOS, Linux and Windows.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! This crate is on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/wifiscanner) and can be
//! used by adding `wifiscanner` to the dependencies in your project's `Cargo.toml`.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! wifiscanner = "0.4.*"
//! ```
//!
//! and this to your crate root:
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate wifiscanner;
//! ```
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use wifiscanner;
//! println!("{:?}", wifiscanner::scan());
//! ```
//!
//! Alternatively if you've cloned the the Git repo, you can run the above example
//! using: `cargo run --example scan`.

//TODO need to find a way to move these out of lib and into sys or better still windows module
